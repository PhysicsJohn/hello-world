# hello-world
this is my first github repository. Oh boy!
My name is John

I have coding experience mainly in Matlab and a tiny bit in c#

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing at thi point!
My matlab experience is quite something though. I made my own finite element method for ferromagnetic materials in it in an internship.
it was pretty bad though.
